    text: |-
      The Hacker Analytics Malware Report gives you a clear, focused view of what’s happening in the wild. Each week, we track the latest malware families, campaigns, and techniques targeting IT environments across industries.

      You’ll learn how attackers gain access, what payloads they deploy, and which defenses are working. We break down key indicators, behavioral patterns, and mitigation strategies in a way that’s practical for both new and experienced defenders.

      Each report covers:

      - Active malware families and new variants
      - Initial access methods and infection chains
      - Capabilities, persistence, and evasion tactics
      - Detection insights you can apply right away

      Stay informed about what’s spreading, what’s changing, and what to watch next.
