    subtitle: Weekly catalog of attacker tools and offensive techniques
    text: |-
      The Hacker Analytics Red Team Tools roundup explains the tools, scripts, and tactics adversaries use in real operations. Each week we identify new and trending tools found in the wild, show how they are used, and explain what defenders should monitor.

      You will get clear summaries that make technical tradecraft actionable for IT teams and junior analysts. Our goal is to show the tool chain, typical workflows, and detection points so you can harden systems and spot attacker behavior sooner.

      Each issue includes:

      - Tool spotlight with purpose and capabilities
      - Typical usage scenarios and command examples
      - Known variants, repos, and delivery methods
      - Practical detection tips and defensive controls

      Keep pace with offensive trends so your blue team can respond faster and smarter.
