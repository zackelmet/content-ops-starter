    subtitle: How CTI Agents help satisfy PCI DSS and SOC 2 requirements
    text: >-
      Our CTI agents provide continuous monitoring, event logging, and actionable intelligence—core requirements under both PCI DSS and SOC 2.

      **PCI DSS Alignment:**  
      According to PCI DSS Requirement 10, organizations must “track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data,” and Requirement 11.4 calls for “intrusion-detection and/or intrusion-prevention techniques to detect and/or prevent intrusions.”  
      CTI Agents deliver continuous monitoring and logging, fulfilling these obligations while providing intelligence context to detected events.

      **SOC 2 Alignment:**  
      Under the Security Trust Services Criteria, organizations must “monitor system components and the operation of those components to identify deviations from expected configurations.”  
      CTI Agents generate detailed event logs and intelligence alerts that demonstrate active system monitoring and risk management—helping maintain SOC 2 readiness.
