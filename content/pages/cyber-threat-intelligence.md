    subtitle: Build a CTI program and deploy autonomous agents that enhance compliance and visibility
    text: |-
      We design and deploy autonomous CTI agents and workflows that collect, analyze, and deliver actionable threat intelligence while aligning with regulatory and audit requirements.

      Our agents integrate with SIEMs, alerting pipelines, and auditing systems so organizations can demonstrate continuous monitoring and proactive detection.

      "Continuous monitoring of system components and their configurations is necessary to identify deviations from expected behavior." — NIST

      "Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data." — PCI DSS Requirement 10

      "Monitor system components and the operation of those components to identify deviations from expected configurations." — SOC 2

      We design agents to collect the specific telemetry these standards require and produce auditable logs and reports to support compliance and operational readiness.
